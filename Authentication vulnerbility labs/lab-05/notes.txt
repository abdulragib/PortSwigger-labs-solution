Lab #5: Username enumeration via response timing

Main goal : Brute force the username and password according to response time

Analysis:

Summary:
In this lab , we use x-forward-for to spoof ip address for bypassing the ip protection
and we use burp intruder to brute force the username according to the 
response time , we need to update the value of x-forward-for to bypass the ip protection
and for that we use pitchfork attack in burp intruder, we have to set the wrong
password with more than 100 character, so if username is correct then it will take time to 
verify password and we can confirm correct username, if the response time is high
then we got the username and if we got 302 means then we got username and password
